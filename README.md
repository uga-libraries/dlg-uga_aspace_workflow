DLG needs our finding aids to be sent as structured data (csv, JSON, etc.). Currently, we are sending them the ead from 
ASpace, and they are struggling to map it to Excel in order to get a spreadsheet that meets their needs.

Create a program to extract data from ASpace and put directly into main spreadsheet for users to copy and send to DLG.
